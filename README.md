# Northcoders News API

To connect to the databases locally you must have installed the dotenv dependancy and then make two files, one called .env.test and one called .env.development. Inside .env.test add this code: PGDATABASE=nc_news_test.

In the file .env.development add this code: PGDATABASE=nc_news.

We're assigning the databases here where PG is PostGres.
